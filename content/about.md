I've been studying computer science for the last 4 years.
My passion for computer science sparked first when I read the first few chapters of an amazing book named "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" by two legendary MIT professors: Harold Abelson & Gerald Jay Susman.

Hence, I started out with glorius Lisp programming language and fell in love with the Functional Programming Paradigm [I like Object-Oriented Design too].


My favorite programming languages are Go, Rust and of course, Lisp. I speak a bit of Java, Python and Haskell as well.

I am currently working on multiple projects simultaniously, including:

* [Routing Library for Go Programming Language](https://github.com/IsroilMukhitdinov/aviccena)
* [Share Epiphany](https://nofluffhere.com) 
* [Muslim Prayer Times Command-Line Application](https://github.com/IsroilMukhitdinov/Prayer_Times)
