# Hey! I'm Izzy Mukhitdinov

I am a software engineer who loves to make software applications that are flexible, robust and most importantly modular. 

I love to think of computer science and the process of writing software not as just an intellectual activity of the mind, but as an expression of art. 

Here you can find me writing posts about various topics of computer science.
